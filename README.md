# Needtoeat
A webpage where users can decide if they want to eat at home or go out. Based on this selection and a few choices, they are given suggestions on what to make or where to go. Uses the edamam api for recipes and yelp fusion api for nearby resturants to eat at. If you decide to try this project, there is some things to do. 
1. In the javascript file, replace APP_ID and APP_KEY with your own from edamam.
2. Replace YELP_AUTH with your own api key from yelp.
3. Replace YELP_ORIGIN with your own.
4. Lastly, at your own risk, follow this link and request temporary access. This allows the project to bypass any cors access origin issues. https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo
5. These all issues I hope to resolve one day after gaining more experience and knowledge with servers.
